# Installation
You need `grunt` and the Ruby gem `sass` for this to work. Run both of the commands below:

```
npm install grunt --global
```

```
gem add sass
```

You can then run the bot or page separately!

We use a Digital Ocean droplet to host our bot. Follow [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/flask-nginx-uwsgi-ubuntu-tutorial?answer=35613) if you'd like to do the same.
